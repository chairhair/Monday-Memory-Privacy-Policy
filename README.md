# Monday Memory Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy for MondayMemory

Last updated: January 2026

MondayMemory (“MondayMemory,” “MM,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have.

If you don’t like policies that pretend they don’t collect anything while quietly hoarding your soul — good. Neither do we.

1. Information We Collect
1.1 Information You Provide

When you use MondayMemory, you may provide:

Account information
Email address
Username or display name
Authentication identifiers (e.g., OAuth or tokens)
User-generated content
Notes, messages, or text you explicitly ask MondayMemory to store or process
Commands and queries you send to the service (e.g. /start-record, /query)

1.2 Automatically Collected Information

We may automatically collect limited technical data, including:

IP address (short-lived, for security and abuse prevention)
Timestamps of requests
Basic usage metadata (e.g., command invoked, success/failure)
Device or client type (browser, extension, Discord client, etc.)
We do not collect invasive analytics, keystroke tracking, or cross-site behavioral data.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information only to:

Provide and operate MondayMemory’s core features
Store and recall information at your explicit direction
Authenticate users and enforce usage limits
Process payments and subscriptions (via third-party providers)
Detect abuse, fraud, or service-breaking behavior
Improve system reliability and performance

We do not sell your data.
We do not train advertising models on your content.
We do not scrape your life “just in case.”

3. How Memory Works (Important)

MondayMemory stores information only when you explicitly ask it to.
Memory is opt-in, not ambient surveillance
We do not silently record conversations
You control what is stored and when it is recalled
Guest users may have stricter limits or temporary storage

If it wasn’t deliberately recorded, it isn’t remembered.

4. Data Storage & Security

Data is stored using industry-standard infrastructure
Access is restricted to essential system operations
We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your data

That said: no system is invincible. We reduce risk aggressively, but we don’t lie about perfection.

5. Payments & Third-Party Services

We rely on trusted third-party providers for critical services, including:
Payment processing (e.g., Stripe)
Email delivery (e.g., transactional support emails)
Hosting and infrastructure
These providers process data only as necessary to perform their services and are contractually obligated to protect it.

We do not share your personal data with advertisers. Ever.

6. Data Retention

We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide the service

You may request deletion of your data at any time

Some limited data may be retained temporarily for legal, security, or billing purposes

When you leave, we don’t cling.

7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

Access the data we have about you

Correct inaccurate information

Request deletion of your data

Export your data (where technically feasible)

To exercise these rights, contact us at: mm-llm-email@proton.me

8. Children’s Privacy

MondayMemory is not intended for children under 13.
If we discover we’ve collected data from a child unintentionally, we’ll delete it promptly.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
If changes are material, we’ll make reasonable efforts to notify users.

No sneaky retroactive nonsense.

10. Contact Us

We take privacy seriously — not performatively.
